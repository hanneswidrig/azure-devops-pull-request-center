## 📐 Features

- Modern UI based on Azure DevOps Design System.
- At a quick glance information about pull request across all your repositories.
- Advanced filtering and full screen experience.

## 🧩 Compatibility

I built this extension for Azure DevOps Services 2019. If someone wanted to explore/test older versions of DevOps with source code modifications, I might be able to add support.
